                        For the production Mr. Burns, the scene had a great deal of involvement. The shop built multiple moving sets - including a car, a power station, and a piece of a house with a balcony and roof balcony. The shop painted the floor of the Kipling theater and painted a back drop. There were also a large amount of props that were involved in this show.
