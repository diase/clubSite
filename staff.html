        <h3>Work Study Testimonials</h3>

        <div class="testimonial">
            <p>"I have worked in the scene shop for a little over a year now and I am so glad to have found what I deem to be the best place to work on campus. Savannah and Fritz are the best people I have ever worked for and I have learned so much in the span of a bit over two semesters. The scene shop is an interesting place filled with interesting people - in the best way possible. The best parts are undoubtedly the people, the umbrella graveyard, getting fired, and the gnomes."</p>

        <div class="testimonial">
             <p>"Working with Tim and the rest of the people in the scene shop has been a very rewarding experience. I have never had a job that was different everyday, or a job where I learned something new almost everytime I went. Being a work study in the scene shop is a job that doesn't feel like a job and that's a really amazing thing. From splattering a cave with glow-in-the-dark paint to sewing fabric for a gaint cigarette, there truly is never a dull moment with the work I do for and with Tim. I am so grateful that I have the opportunity to spend 10 hours a week at the scene shop and I could not ask for a better boss." </p>
